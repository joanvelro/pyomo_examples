"""
n this refinery optimization model, the sets model.P and model.R represent the products and refinery units, respectively.

The parameters model.Demand, model.Cost, model.Capacity, model.Yield, and model.Price represent the demand for each product, the operating cost for each refinery unit, the capacity of each refinery unit, the yield of each refinery unit for each product, and the selling price for each product, respectively.

The decision variables model.Production and model.ResourceAllocation represent the production levels for each product and the resource allocation for each refinery unit, respectively.

The objective function aims to maximize the profitability, calculated as the sum of the revenue from selling products minus the operating cost for each refinery unit.

The constraints ensure that the production levels are determined based on the yield and resource allocation for each product and refinery unit. The capacity constraint limits the resource allocation for each refinery unit, and the demand constraint ensures that the production levels do not exceed the demand for each product.

Make sure to replace <solver_name> with the name of the solver you have installed (e.g., glpk, cplex, gurobi) before running the code.

Note: This is a simplified example,
