"""
In this trading optimization model, the set model.I represents the assets available for trading. The parameters
 model.Return and model.Volatility represent the expected return and volatility of each asset. The parameters
 model.Budget, model.MaxWeight, and model.MinWeight represent the total available capital, maximum weight allowed for
 each asset, and minimum weight allowed for each asset, respectively.

The decision variable model.Weight represents the weight of each asset in the portfolio. The objective function
aims to maximize the total return of the portfolio. The constraints ensure that the total weight of assets in the
portfolio does not exceed the available capital and that the weights of individual assets fall within the specified
 limits.

Make sure to replace <solver_name> with the name of the solver you have installed (e.g., glpk, cplex, gurobi) before
running the code.

Note: This is a simplified example, and actual trading strategies may involve additional constraints, risk management
techniques, and considerations. It's important to carefully evaluate and adjust the model based on specific trading
 objectives, market conditions, and risk tolerance.
