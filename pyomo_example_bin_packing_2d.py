"""
In this 2D bin packing problem optimization model, the sets model.Items and model.Bins represent the items and bins, respectively.

The parameters model.Width and model.Height represent the width and height of each item, respectively. The parameters model.BinWidth and model.BinHeight represent the width and height of each bin, respectively.

The decision variable model.Placement represents the placement of each item in each bin, taking binary values (0 or 1).

The objective function aims to minimize the number of bins used, calculated as the sum of the placement variables for all items and bins.

The constraints ensure that each item is placed in exactly one bin, and the placement of items in each bin does not exceed the capacity of the bin.

Make sure to replace <solver_name> with the name of the solver you have installed (e.g., glpk, cplex, gurobi) before running the code.

Note: This is a simplified example, and there are various techniques and heuristics available to solve the 2D bin packing problem more efficiently.
