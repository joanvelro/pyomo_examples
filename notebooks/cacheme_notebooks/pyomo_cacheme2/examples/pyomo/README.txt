==============

These examples illustrates the use of Pyomo to formulate math programming
optimization problems.  Currently, these examples are for linear programming
and integer programming problems.

  Examples drawn from the book: AMPL: A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming (2nd edition)

  See amplbook2/README.txt for details

* benders

  An example of adapting the AMPL Benders scripting example to work with Pyomo

* diet

  A simple example using the classic diet problem.

  See diet/README.txt for details
