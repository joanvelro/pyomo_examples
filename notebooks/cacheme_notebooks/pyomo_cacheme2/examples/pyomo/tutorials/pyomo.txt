Pyomo can be run with the 'pyomo' command-line executable:

  pyomo model.py model.dat

By default, pyomo simply summarizes the solver results.  The optimization
logfile can be printed with the '-l' option, and the final solution can
be summarized with the '-s' option:

  pyomo -l -s model.py model.dat

The Python file model.py can contain arbitrary Python code.  However,
pyomo checks to see if this file creates a 'model' object that is a Pyomo
Model instance.  If so, it does the following:

  1. Generate a model instance, using a data file if that is provided
  2. Create a Pyomo optimization solver
  3. Optimize the model instance
  4. Summarize the optimization results

You can get further information by typing:

  pyomo --help
