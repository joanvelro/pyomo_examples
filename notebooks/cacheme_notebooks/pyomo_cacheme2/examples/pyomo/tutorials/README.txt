Pyomo Tutorials
===============

This directory contains Pyomo tutorials that illustrate the different
objects used by Pyomo to define optimization models.  Although these 
tutorials can be read independently, the following order will 
help introduce the Pyomo design in an incremental fashion:

  set.py	Detailed examples using sets of numeric and string values
  param.py	Detailed examples using numeric parameters
  data.py	Examples of how data can be represented with different
                formats (in data.dat)
  excel.py  Examples of how data can be imported from an Excel
                spreadsheet
  table.py  Examples of how data can be imported from *.tab files

  pyomo.txt	A quick summary of the use of the 'pyomo' executable.

The examples with a ".py" suffix can be executed using the pyomo virtualized
python executable, found in pyomo/bin.
