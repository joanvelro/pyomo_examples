# Running Pyomo on the Notre Dame CRC Cluster

This documentation gives a brief overview for using Pyomo on the CRC clusters with a variety of solvers.

## Preliminaries

Before proceeding with this tutorial, you need to obtain a CRC account and install a private copy of Pyomo on the CRC cluster.

### Request a CRC Account

First, you must [register for a CRC account](https://wiki.crc.nd.edu/w/index.php/How_to_Obtain_a_CRC_Account). These are free for all ND researchers.


### Install Pyomo on CRC Cluster

Per CRC policies, standalone Python packages such as Pyomo are not centrally installed or maintained. Instead, users must [install their own private (i.e., local) copy](https://wiki.crc.nd.edu/w/index.php/Python#Installing_Python_Packages_Locally) on the CRC cluster. This can be easily done in a few steps:

First, `ssh` into a CRC interactive node. For example,

```bash
ssh crcfe02.crc.nd.edu
```

Next (optional), may load your preferred version of Python. If you do not, the system default (2.7) will be used. Pyomo supports both 2.7 and 3.x:

```bash
module load python/3.6.4
```

Then, install Pyomo using `pip`, a popular package manager for Python:

```bash
pip install --user pyomo
```

By default, Pyomo will be installed in ```.local/bin```. You will need to add this folder to your PATH. See the [CRC wiki](https://wiki.crc.nd.edu/w/index.php/Python#Adding_.24.7BHOME.7D.2F.local.2Fbin_to_your_path) for additional instructions.

## Running on the CRC

There are two ways to run Pyomo on the CRC cluster: on an interactive mode (for testing only) or by submitting a job to the queue. The following shows how to do this for a simple optimization problem.

### Test Problem

We will consider the following simple linear program to test Pyomo on the CRC:

```python
# Load Pyomo
from pyomo.environ import *

# Create model
m = ConcreteModel()
m.x = Var([1,2,3], domain=NonNegativeReals)
m.c1 = Constraint(expr = m.x[1] + m.x[2] + m.x[3] <= 1)
m.c2 = Constraint(expr = m.x[1] + 2*m.x[2] >= 0.3)
m.OBJ = Objective(expr = m.x[3], sense=maximize) 

# Specify solver
solver=SolverFactory('ipopt')

# Solve model
solver.solve(m, tee=True)
```

Copy this code and save it on your CRC AFS space as `pyomo_test.py`.

### Running From the Command Line

The easest option is to directly run this code on an interactive node on the CRC cluster.

1. Login to the CRC cluster:

```bash
ssh crcfe02.crc.nd.edu
```

2. Load your preferred version of python and your favorite optimization solver.

```bash
module load ipopt
```

3. Run the Python script

```bash
python pyomo_test.py
```

You should see the following output:

```

### Submitting to a Queue

Per CRC policies, the interactive nodes should only be used for testing short computational jobs. All other jobs should be submitted to a queue.
 
 To submit the previous project on the CRC queue, write a script that contains the following:
 
 ```
 #!/bin/csh
 
 #$ -M netid@nd.edu		# Email address for job notification
 #$ -m abe		 		      # Send mail when job aborts, begins, and ends
 #$ -q long		 		     # Specify queue
 #$ -N job_name	     # Specify job name
 
 module load python/3.6.4     # Required modules
 module load ipopt
 
 python3 pyomo_test.py 		  # Command to execute
 ```
 
 Name it something logical, such as `submission_script`. Then type:
 
 ```
 qsub submission_script
 ```
 
 You should get an email when your job begins/ends/aborts. You can also monitor its process through
 
```
 qstat â€“u username
 ```
 
 More info is available at the [ND CRC wiki](https://wiki.crc.nd.edu/w/index.php/CRC_Quick_Start_Guide). 

## Available Solvers

The CRC clusters supports several large-scale optimization solvers that are directly callable from Pyomo. This makes it increadily easy - often one only needs to change a few lines of code - to try different solvers for an optimization problem.

The following contains instructions on using solvers currently available on the CRC cluster. By modifying the `SolverFactory` in `pyomo_test.py`, you can try all of these solvers on the simple test problem.

### CPLEX

First load the module:

```module load cplex```

This will update your environmental variables and the Gurobi executable should be callable from Pyomo:

```python
solver=SolverFactory('cplex')
```

Here is the output for the test problem:

### Gurobi

First load the module:

```module load gurobi```

This will update your environmental variables and the Gurobi executable should be callable from Pyomo:

```python
solver=SolverFactory('gurobi')
```

Here is the output for the test problem:
```

### Ipopt

Two versions (modules) of Ipopt are available to CRC users: `ipopt/3.12.8` and `ipopt/hsl/3.12.8`. The latter supports HSL linear algebra routines whereas the former does not (and relies on the open-source library MUMPS). In general, the HSL linear algebra routines are more stable and are significantly faster for large-scale problems. All IPOPT users are strongly encouraged to use the HSL libraries. To obtain access to `ipopt/hsl/3.12.8`, ND users must apply for a [free academic license](http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/download/coinhsl/2015.06.23/) and then forward the approval email to CRCSupport@nd.edu. 

To use either version of Ipopt, first load the module. For example,

```module load ipopt/hsl/3.12.8```

This will update your environmental variables and the ipopt executable should be callable from Pyomo:

```python
solver=SolverFactory('ipopt')
```

If needed, you can also directly specify the path to the Ipopt executable to Pyomo:

```python
solver=SolverFactory('ipopt', executable="/afs/crc.nd.edu/x86_64_linux/i/ipopt/3.12.8-hsl/bin/ipopt")
```

Next, you may want to customize some of the [Ipopt options](https://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation/node40.html). For example, specify the linear algebra routine (use MA57 from the HSL library):

```python
solver.options['linear_solver'] = "ma57"
```

Here is the output when using MA57:

```
Ipopt 3.12.8: linear_solver=ma57

### Coin-OR

Several solvers are availabe in the COIN-OR module.

The first step to using any of these solvers is loading the module:

```module load coin-or```

#### Clp

```

Output for the test problem:

#### Bonmin

**Warning**: Bonmin has been compiled using the HSL linear algebra routines. All users that have access to Ipopt with HSL also have access to Bonmin.

After you submit your HSL license approval email to CRCsupport@nd.edu, the Bonmin solver executable will be callable from Pyomo:

```python
solver=SolverFactory('bonmin')
```

If needed, you can explicitly specify the path to the executable:

```python
solver=SolverFactory('bonmin', executable="/afs/crc.nd.edu/x86_64_linux/c/coin-or/bonmin/1.8.6/bin/bonmin")
```

Output for the test problem:

solver=SolverFactory('couenne', executable="/afs/crc.nd.edu/x86_64_linux/c/coin-or/couenne/0.5.6/bin/couenne")
```

Output for the test problem:
```
