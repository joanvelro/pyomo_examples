"""
In this biofuel purchase optimization model, the sets model.B and model.T represent the biofuels and time periods, respectively.

The parameter model.Cost represents the cost of each biofuel. The parameter model.BlendRequirement represents the blend requirement for each time period, specifying the desired quantity of biofuels to be blended. The parameter model.Availability represents the availability of each biofuel in each time period.

The decision variable model.Purchase represents the quantity of each biofuel to be purchased in each time period.

The objective function aims to minimize the total cost of purchasing biofuels, calculated as the sum of the cost of each biofuel multiplied by the quantity purchased.

The constraints ensure that the blend requirements are met by setting the sum of purchased quantities equal to the blend requirement for each time period. Additionally, the availability constraint ensures that the purchased quantities do not exceed the availability of each biofuel in each time period.

Make sure to replace <solver_name> with the name of the solver you have installed (e.g., glpk, cplex, gurobi) before running the code.

Note: This is a simplified example, and actual biofuel purchase optimization models may involve additional constraints and considerations based on specific requirements and constraints of the biofuel market.
