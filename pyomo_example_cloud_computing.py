"""
In this cloud computing optimization model, the sets model.VMs and model.Servers represent the virtual machines and physical servers, respectively.

The parameters model.CPU and model.Memory represent the CPU and memory requirements of each VM, respectively. The parameter model.Energy represents the energy consumption of each server.

The decision variable model.Allocation represents the allocation of each VM to each server, taking binary values (0 or 1).

The objective function aims to minimize the overall energy consumption, calculated as the sum of the energy consumption of all servers.

The constraints ensure that the resource requirements of each VM are satisfied and that each server can only host at most one VM.

Make sure to replace <solver_name> with the name of the solver you have installed (e.g., glpk, cplex, gurobi) before running the code.

Note: This is a simplified example, and there are various other factors and constraints that can be considered in a cloud computing optimization problem, such as network bandwidth, storage requirements, and server capacity.
